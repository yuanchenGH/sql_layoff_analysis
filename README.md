# SQL Project: Data Cleaning and Exploration

## Project Overview

This project focuses on utilizing SQL for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to transform raw datasets into clean, analyzable forms and extract meaningful insights. SQL queries are used to perform operations like handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and summarizing data.

## Objectives

### Data Cleaning:

Handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent values.

Standardize data formats (e.g., dates, strings, numerical values).

### Data Exploration:

Perform descriptive analysis using aggregate functions.

Identify trends, distributions, and outliers.
